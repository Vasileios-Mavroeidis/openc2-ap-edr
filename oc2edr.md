# 1 Introduction

_The content in this section is non-normative, except where it is marked normative._

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and control of cyber defense systems and components. OpenC2 typically uses a request-response paradigm where a _Command_ is encoded by a _Producer_ (managing application) and transferred to a _Consumer_ (managed device or virtualized function) using a secure transfer protocol, and the Consumer can respond with status and any requested information.

OpenC2 allows the application producing the commands to discover the set of capabilities supported by the managed devices. These capabilities permit the managing application to adjust its behavior to take advantage of the features exposed by the managed device. The capability definitions can be easily extended in a noncentralized manner, allowing standard and non-standard capabilities to be defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.

## 1.2 Terminology

_This section is normative._

* **Action**: The task or activity to be performed (e.g., 'deny').
* **Actuator**: The function performed by the Consumer that executes the Command (e.g., 'Endpoint Response').
* **Argument**: A property of a Command that provides additional information on how to perform the Command, such as date/time, periodicity, duration, etc.
* **Command**: A Message defined by an Action-Target pair that is sent from a Producer and received by a Consumer.
* **Consumer**: A managed device / application that receives Commands. Note that a single device / application can have both Consumer and Producer capabilities.
* **Message**: A content- and transport-independent set of elements conveyed between Consumers and Producers.
* **Producer**: A manager application that sends Commands.
* **Response**: A Message from a Consumer to a Producer acknowledging a Command or returning the requested resources or status to a previously received Command.
* **Specifier**: A property or field that identifies a Target or Actuator to some level of precision.
* **Target**: The object of the Action, i.e., the Action is performed on the Target (e.g., device).

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119]](#rfc2119) and [[RFC8174]](#rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## 1.6 Overview
In general, there are two types of participants involved in the exchange of OpenC2 Messages, as depicted in Figure 1-1:
1. **Producers**: A Producer is an entity that creates Commands to provide instruction to one or more systems to act in accordance with the content of the Command. A Producer may receive and process Responses in conjunction with a Command.
2. **Consumers**: A Consumer is an entity that receives and may act upon a Command. A Consumer may create Responses that provide any information captured or necessary to send back to the Producer.

![OpenC2 Message Exchange](images/image_1.png)

**Figure 1-1. OpenC2 Message Exchange**

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications for Producers and Consumers to command and execute cyber defense functions. These specifications include the OpenC2 Language Specification, Actuator Profiles, and Transfer Specifications. The OpenC2 Language Specification and Actuator Profile specifications focus on the language content and meaning at the Producer and Consumer of the Command and Response while the transfer specifications focus on the protocols for their exchange.
* The **OpenC2 Language Specification ([[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10))** provides the semantics for the essential elements of the language, the structure for Commands and Responses, and the schema that defines the proper syntax for the language elements that represents the Command or Response.
* **OpenC2 Actuator Profiles** specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in the context of specific Actuator functions. Cyber defense components, devices, systems and/or instances may (in fact are likely to) implement multiple Actuator profiles. Actuator profiles extend the language by defining Specifiers that identify the Actuator to the required level of precision. Actuator Profiles may define Command Arguments and Targets that are relevant and/or unique to those Actuator functions.
* **OpenC2 Transfer Specifications** utilize existing protocols and standards to implement OpenC2 in specific environments. These standards are used for communications and security functions beyond the scope of the language, such as message transfer encoding, authentication, and end-to-end transport of OpenC2 Messages.

The OpenC2 Language Specification defines a language used to compose Messages for command and control of cyber defense systems and components. A Message consists of a header and a payload (_defined_ as a Message body in the OpenC2 Language Specification Version 1.0 and _specified_ in one or more Actuator profiles).

The language defines two payload structures:

1. **Command**: An instruction from one system known as the Producer, to one or more systems, the Consumer(s), to act on the content of the Command.
2. **Response**: Any information sent back to the Producer as a result of the Command.

OpenC2 implementations integrate the related OpenC2 specifications described above with related industry specifications, protocols, and standards. Figure 1-2 depicts the relationships among OpenC2 specifications, and their relationships to other industry standards and environment-specific implementations of OpenC2. Note that the layering of implementation aspects in the diagram is notional, and not intended to preclude any particular approach to implementing the needed functionality (for example, the use of an application-layer message signature function to provide message source authentication and integrity).

![OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model](images/image_2.png)

**Figure 1-2. OpenC2 Documentation and Layering Model**

OpenC2 is conceptually partitioned into four layers as shown in Table 1-1.

**Table 1-1. OpenC2 Protocol Layers**

| Layer | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| Function-Specific Content | Actuator Profiles<br>(standard and extensions) |
| Common Content | Language Specification<br>[[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10) |
| Message | Transfer Specifications<br>([[OpenC2-HTTPS-v1.0]](#openc2-https-v10), OpenC2-over-CoAP, ...) |
| Secure Transport | HTTPS, CoAP, MQTT, OpenDXL, ... |

* The **Secure Transport** layer provides a communication path between the Producer and the Consumer. OpenC2 can be layered over any standard transport protocol.
* The **Message** layer provides a transfer- and content-independent mechanism for conveying Messages. A transfer specification maps transfer-specific protocol elements to a transfer-independent set of message elements consisting of content and associated metadata.
* The **Common Content** layer defines the structure of Commands and Responses and a set of common language elements used to construct them.
* The **Function-specific Content** layer defines the language elements used to support a particular cyber defense function. An Actuator profile defines the implementation conformance requirements for that function. Producers and Consumers will support one or more profiles.

The components of a Command are an Action (what is to be done), a Target (what is being acted upon), an optional Actuator (what is performing the command), and Command Arguments, which influence how the Command is to be performed. An Action coupled with a Target is sufficient to describe a complete Command. Though optional, the inclusion of an Actuator and/or Command Arguments provides additional precision to a Command.

The components of a Response are a numerical status code, an optional status text string, and optional results. The format of the results, if included, depend on the type of Response being transferred.

## 1.7 Goal
The goal of the OpenC2 Language Specification is to provide a language for interoperating between functional elements of cyber defense systems. This language used in conjunction with OpenC2 Actuator Profiles and OpenC2 Transfer Specifications allows for vendor-agnostic cybertime response to attacks.

The Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense (IACD) framework defines a collection of activities, based on the traditional OODA (ObserveâOrientâDecideâAct) Loop [[IACD]](#iacd):

* Sensing:  gathering of data regarding system activities
* Sense Making:  evaluating data using analytics to understand what's happening
* Decision Making:  determining a course-of-action to respond to system events
* Acting:  Executing the course-of-action

The goal of OpenC2 is to enable coordinated defense in cyber-relevant time between decoupled blocks that perform cyber defense functions. OpenC2 focuses on the Acting portion of the IACD framework; the assumption that underlies the design of OpenC2 is that the sensing/analytics have been provisioned and the decision to act has been made. This goal and these assumptions guide the design of OpenC2:

* **Technology Agnostic:**  The OpenC2 language defines a set of abstract atomic cyber defense actions in a platform and implementation agnostic manner
* **Concise:**  A Command is intended to convey only the essential information required to describe the action required and can be represented in a very compact form for communications-constrained environments
* **Abstract:**  Commands and Responses are defined abstractly and can be encoded and transferred via multiple schemes as dictated by the needs of different implementation environments
* **Extensible:**  While OpenC2 defines a core set of Actions and Targets for cyber defense, the language is expected to evolve with cyber defense technologies, and permits extensions to accommodate new cyber defense technologies.

## 1.8 Purpose and Scope

An 'Endpoint Detection and Response' (EDR) system is a security mechanism which identifies malicious behaviours by recording system activities and comparing them to sets of signatures or heuristics. EDR systems facilitate in digital forensics and incident response by storing and indexing said events, as well as provide functionality to respond to security incidents as they pertain to actively exploited, infected or vulnerable endpoints.

This Actuator profile specifies the set of Actions, Targets, Specifiers, and Command Arguments that integrates EDR functionality with the Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Command set. Through this Command set, cyber security orchestrators may gain visibility into and provide control over the EDR functionality in a manner that is independent of the instance of the EDR function.

All components, devices and systems that provide EDR functionality will implement the OpenC2 Actions, Targets, Specifiers and Arguments identified as required in this document. Actions that are applicable, but not necessarily required, for EDR will be identified as optional.

The purpose of this document is to:

* Identify the required and optional OpenC2 Actions for Actuators with EDR functionality
* Identify the required and optional Target types for each Action in the EDR class of Actuators
* Identify Actuator-Specifiers and Arguments for each Action/Target pair that are applicable and/or unique to the EDR class of Actuators
* Annotate each Action/Target pair with a justification and example, and provide sample OpenC2 Commands to a EDR with corresponding Responses

This EDR profile:

* Does not define or implement Actions beyond those defined in Version 1.0 of the [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10)
* Is consistent with Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification

Cyber defense systems that are utilizing OpenC2 may require the following components to implement the EDR profile:

* OpenC2 Producers: Devices that send Commands, receive Responses, and manage the execution of Commands involving one or more EDR or other Actuators with EDR capability. The OpenC2 Producer needs _a prior_ knowledge of which Commands the Actuator can process and execute, therefore must understand the profiles for any device that it intends to command
* OpenC2 Consumers: Devices or instances that provide endpoint detection and response functions. Typically these are Actuators that execute the cyber defense function, but could be orchestrators (i.e., a device or instance that forwards Commands to the Actuator)

# 2 OpenC2 Language Binding for Endpoint Response

_This section is normative_

This section defines the set of Actions, Targets, Specifiers, and Arguments that are meaningful in the context of Endpoint Response (ER). This section also describes the appropriate format for the status and properties of a Response frame. This section is organized into three major subsections; Command Components, Response Components and Commands.

Extensions to the Language Specification are defined in accordance with [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]](#openc2-lang-v10), Section 3.1.5, where:

1. The unique name of the EDR schema is `oasis-open.org/openc2/v1.0/ap-edr`
2. The namespace identifier (nsid) referring to the EDR schema is:  `edr`
3. The definitions of and conformance requirements for these types are contained in this document

## 2.1 OpenC2 Command Components
The components of an OpenC2 Command include Actions, Targets, Actuators and associated Arguments and Specifiers. Appropriate aggregation of the components will define a Command-body that is meaningful in the context of an EDR.

This specification identifies the applicable components of an OpenC2 Command. The components of an OpenC2 Command include:

* Action:  A subset of the Actions defined in the OpenC2 Language Specification that are meaningful in the context of an EDR.
    * This profile SHALL NOT define Actions that are external to Version 1.0 of the [OpenC2 Language Specification](#openc2-lang-v10)
    * This profile MAY augment the definition of the Actions in the context of an EDR
    * This profile SHALL NOT define Actions in a manner that is inconsistent with version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification
* Target:  A subset of the Targets and Target-Specifiers defined in Version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification that are meaningful in the context of EDR and one Target (and its associated Specifier) that is defined in this specification
* Arguments:  A subset of the Arguments defined in the Language Specification and a set of Arguments defined in this specification
* Actuator:  A set of specifiers defined in this specification that are meaningful in the context of EDR

### 2.1.1 Actions

# Annex A: Sample Commands

_This section is non-normative_

This section will summarize and provide examples of OpenC2 Commands as they pertain to EDR systems. The sample Commands will be encoded in verbose JSON.

## A.1 deny, contain and allow

### A.1.1 Ban a binary by hash on every endpoint

**Command:**

```json
{
  "action": "deny",
  "target": {
    "file": {
      "hash": "0a73291ab5607aef7db23863cf8e72f55bcb3c273bb47f00edf011515aeb5894"
    }
  },
  "actuator": {
    "edr": {}
  }
}
```
**Responses:**

Case One: the Actuator successfully issued the deny.

```json
{
  "status": 200
}
```

Case Two: the Command failed due to a syntax error in the Command. Optional status text is ignored by the Producer, but may be added to provide error details for debugging or logging.

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "status_text": "Validation Error: Target: flie"
}
```

Case Three: the Command failed because an Argument was not supported.

```json
{
  "status": 501
}
```

### A.1.2 Port isolate a specific endpoint

**Command:**

```json
{
  "action": "contain",
  "target": {
    "device": {
      "hostname": "DESKTOP-123ABC"
    }
  },
  "args": {
    "edr": {
      "containment":"port_isolation"
    }
   },
  "actuator": {
    "edr": {}
  }
}
```

### A.1.3 Allow unrestricted app execution on a group of endpoints

**Command:**

```json
{
  "action": "allow",
  "target": {
    "device": {}
  },
  "args": {
    "edr": {
      "containment":"app_restriction"
    }
   },
  "actuator": {
    "edr": {
       "named_group":"accounting"
    }
  }
}
```

## A.2 Set

### A.2.1 Set an account on a specific endpoint to be enabled

**Command:**

```json
{
  "action": "set",
  "target": {
    "account": {
       "uid":"S-1-5-21-7375663-6890924511-1272660413-2944159"
    }
  },
  "args": {
    "edr": {
      "account_status":"enabled"
    }
   },
  "actuator": {
    "edr": {
       "hostname": "edr_oslo"
    }
  }
}
```

### A.2.1 Set accounts on a group of endpoints to be disabled

**Command:**

```json
{
  "action": "set",
  "target": {
    "account": {
       "account_name":"sql_admin"
    }
